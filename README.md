## :fire: Requirements :fire:

Mapbox requires apiKey to work with. 
Copy `.env.example` -> change name to .env.local and fill missing data


```
NEXT_PUBLIC_MAPBOX_ACCESS_TOKEN=pk.eyJ1IjoiaW56a29ybmVsIiwiYSI6ImNraTI1MGJjMTF0bnUycm1wemR6ZDU0c24ifQ.OyqdJkvyRjZiIKyiwbGsNg
```

I know i shouldn't put any sensitive data to repository and other than that provide it via environmant variables throught Ci/CD. But let's make a exception in this case :P
